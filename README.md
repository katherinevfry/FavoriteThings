# FavoriteThings

- Create at least four classes, each representing one of your favorite things. Something generic like a book, a car, or a beach.
- Give each of these things two or more properties (attributes) like Location, Name, Age, etc.
- Give each of these things two or more methods (behavior) like Open, Fly, etc.
    - At this point, your methods only need to Console.WriteLine sentences to represent the behavior.
- Inside your `Main` method, create at least two instances of each of your favorite things.
